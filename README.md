# Slot Machine game
Simple slot machine game made using Javascript

> In this project I'm using prompt-sync package to get user input.

## Description
This simple slot machine game allows user to enter balance they have to play.
User then can pick how many lines they want to bet on and allows them to say how much they want to bet per line out of their balance.

> Remember that you should always gamble responsibly ğŸ˜Š

After every game the user is asked if they want to continue playing unless they run out of money which  will stop the game.

## Issues
The game isn't perfect as it's missing any type of UI as it's fully console based. 
There is also a lot of things that can be done better, for example currently if the user wins on one line the winnings is paid out if they won from all lines. 
> and if you find any please raise it as an issue so I can look into it.
